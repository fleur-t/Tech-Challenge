# Tech-Challenge
In this project I will try to make a agenda organiser for teams, so teams can make different tasks and they can asign it to the person who needs to do it.
I am going to make this in two days and I hope that I can finish, if not I will add a document with information about what I missed and how I think you could best fix it.

A small company is managing tasks with chat messages and loose notes. The result: tasks get lost, confusing priorities, and little visibility into the team's actual progress.

They want a simple web application to centralize their work on a visual board, easy to use, where anyone can understand the status of each task in seconds.

# How to run?
To run this project you clone this reposetory in a map in your files, when you open that map you go to the cmd and you type 'npm run dev' and than you can click on a localhost link and then you're in.

# Different functionalities
For now you can add new tasks, you can edit these tasks without changing the date because that will always be the date that the task was made. You can also delete tasks.

# Chosen technologies
For this project I used React, because I find it easier to use. I also used simple css for styling.

# Limitations
For now you can't change the tasks between the different collums, there is also no login page or a database that I used, this is because I used localStorage from react.

# Used AI 
For this project I used ChatGPT to look back on my own old code and asked questions so i could reuse my own old code. I also used it for bug fixes after I couldn't figure it out for myself
