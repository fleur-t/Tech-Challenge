# Tech-Challenge
In this project I will try to make a agenda organiser for teams, so teams can make different tasks and they can asign it to the person who needs to do it.
I am going to make this in two days and I hope that I can finish, if not I will add a document with information about what I missed and how I think you could best fix it.

A small company is managing tasks with chat messages and loose notes. The result: tasks get lost, confusing priorities, and little visibility into the team's actual progress.

They want a simple web application to centralize their work on a visual board, easy to use, where anyone can understand the status of each task in seconds.

# How to run?

For this project I used ChatGPT to look back on my own old code and asked questions so i could reuse my own old code. I also used it for bug fixes after I couldn't figur it out for myself
